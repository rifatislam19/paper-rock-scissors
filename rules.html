    <h2>Rules</h2>
    The game of P, R, S is based on trust, skill and determination.
    The rules are:
    <ul>Each player must make a fist with one hand and hold the other open, palm upward.</ul>
    <ul>Each player must tap their fists in their open palms once, twice, and on the third time form either paper, rock, or scissors.</ul>
    <ul>A rock is formed by keeping the hand in a fist.</ul>
    <ul>A sheet of paper is formed by holding the hand flat, palm down.</ul>
    <ul>A pair of scissors is formed by extending the first two fingers and holding them apart.</ul>
    <ul>If the same item is thrown, it's a tie. Otherwise, rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.</ul>
